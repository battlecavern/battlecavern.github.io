Please provide detailed detailed explanations when commiting. One-line messages are fine, but larger commits should have an extended description

## Code Style
We use [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) as our style guide, which is automatically configured on ESLint.

Here are some of the basic rules:
* Two-space indentation (Soft Tabs)
* Single-quotes for strings
* No unused variables
* No semi-colons
* Never start a line with `(`, `[`, or a backtick (use semi-colons)
* Spaces after keywords
* Space after function name
* Stick to `===` rather than `==`
* Always handle the Node.JS `err` parameter
* Prefix browser globals with `window` (except `document` and `navigator`)
